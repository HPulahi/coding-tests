Any problems or any questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a shout.
 
There isn’t any time limit on it but ideally we would prefer you to get back to us with something by the end of the weekend so we have something to discuss in the face to face interview.
 
Kind regards and good luck,

--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
We would like you to create a simple Ruby on rails application that has a single page with a form to submit a customer request using the POST endpoint of our testing REST API (You can take a look at our website homepage as an example of how we use a similar approach)
 
Form must contain the following fields(See API swagger documentation for the required validations): Customer full name, Business name, Email, Telephone number
 
The initial ruby on rails base project is in here: https://github.com/makeitcheaper/code_test
 
You will find a readme file in the repository explaining how to setup the project and other explanation.
 
You need to:
	0.	Fork the project
	0.	On completion: Send us a link to your public Github URL or create a Pull request.
 
For the API integration - API swagger documentation:  http://mic-leads.dev-test.makeiteasy.com/api/v1/docs#!/Enqueue/post_api_v1_create
 
Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the following requirements have been met:
 
	•	Please complete the user story below.
	•	Your code should run and be fully functional
	•	Feel free to use whatever frameworks / libraries / gems you like.
	•	TDD (Rspec with Unit test, mock external service)
	•	Quality code: Best practices, Separation of concerns, Don’t reinvent the wheel,  Keep the code simple as possible. Refactor as necessary.
	•	If possible commit often so we can see your way of working

User Story
==========

As a user running the application
I can see some basic information about the company and submit my contact details for a call back
So that I can request a call back

Acceptance criteria
-------------------
	•	Page displayed with a basic form to request a call back
	•	Leads are received successfully by the API on form submission
	•	Form fields are validating accordingly
	•	A thank you message is displayed to let you know that your request was submitted successfully and that MakeItCheaper will contact you
	•	When form failed to submit due to being down or an error we want the user to see a nice message instead of a generic error.

Bonus: Create a decent looking homepage (don’t reinvent the wheel use bootstrap)
