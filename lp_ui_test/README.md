=== Coding challenge for L***** Planet
=== User Interface test
======================================


I have coded this project using CSS3 and due to time constraints, I have not been able to create an additional CSS sheet to cover cross browser compatibility issues, mainly with Internet Explorer, older versions of Firefox and Opera.

I have tested the document web page using the latest versions of Firefox, Safari and Chrome, and they work fine, however this was by no means a comprehensive test.
