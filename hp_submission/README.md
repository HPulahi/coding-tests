Lo**ly Planet Ruby coding challenge
=========================================

Herjit Pulahi Submission
=========================================

1. To run please cd into hp_submission directory
2. Run Bundle Install to install any gems
3. Then from the command line type: 
            ruby init.rb
            
4. Please initialized please wait around 20 - 30 secondsfor the data to be processed.

5. To query the data there are four main commands.

find
list
search
quit

E.G:: 

find Lang or find 50
list 123
search 100 200
quit -- This exits out of the program

Quick thoughts
=========================================

I removed clamp, because although it may add a little bit of speed, it didn't really seem like an object oriented way of programming.

Time constraints meant I could not complete this project as well as I would have liked, although the code I have written should give you a good idea.

No specs -- Again time constraints of holding a fulltime Job and completing this. Please see my ggithub links for examples.

Some methods incomplete - I stubbed out some methods where I felt , I could not finish due to time constraints.

Thankyou
